# GHL MCP Server - Railway Deployment & Testing

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUE**
The `/execute-agent` endpoint is returning 404 errors in production on Railway. The Postman screenshot shows:
- **URL**: `https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/execute-agent`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Status**: `404 Not Found`
- **Error**: `Cannot POST /execute-agent`

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**
The codebase has been fully prepared with:
- ✅ Route registered: `app.post('/execute-agent', executeAgentHandler)`
- ✅ TypeScript builds successfully
- ✅ All tests pass (14/14)
- ✅ 404 handler implemented
- ✅ Railway configuration in place

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT TASKS**

### 1. **Deploy to Railway**
```bash
# Option A: Railway CLI
railway up

# Option B: Git push (if auto-deploy enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "Fix /execute-agent 404 error - ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Verify Deployment**
Check Railway logs for these confirmation messages:
```
✅ /execute-agent route registered
MCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
🚀 GHL API Server running on port 3000
🎯 Execute agent: http://localhost:3000/execute-agent
🌐 Railway URL: https://your-app.up.railway.app/execute-agent
📋 Registered routes:
  GET  /health
  POST /execute-agent
  POST /execute-legacy
  POST /clients
  GET  /clients
  DELETE /clients/:clientId
  POST /sessions
✅ Server ready for production deployment on Railway
```

### 3. **Test the Endpoint**
Use this exact Postman request:

**URL**: `https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/execute-agent`
**Method**: `POST`
**Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
**Body**:
```json
{
  "agentName": "nora",
  "clientId": "client_BG",
  "input": "Create a contact named John Doe with email john.doe@example.com and phone 555-123-4567"
}
```

### 4. **Expected Success Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "action": "create_contact",
    "contact": {
      "id": "contact_id_123",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "phone": "5551234567"
    },
    "message": "Contact created for John Doe"
  },
  "agentName": "nora",
  "clientId": "client_BG",
  "input": "Create a contact named John Doe with email john.doe@example.com and phone 555-123-4567",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "responseTime": "150ms"
}
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If 404 persists:
1. **Check Railway logs** for route registration confirmation
2. **Verify environment variables** are set in Railway dashboard
3. **Check `railway.toml`** configuration:
   ```toml
   [[routes]]
   src = "/execute-agent"
   dest = "/execute-agent"
   ```
4. **Review `RAILWAY_DEBUG.md`** for detailed troubleshooting steps

### If route not found in logs:
- Verify `src/index.ts` contains: `app.post('/execute-agent', executeAgentHandler)`
- Check that `executeAgentHandler` is properly imported
- Ensure no middleware is blocking the route

## 📋 **FILES TO VERIFY**
- ✅ `src/index.ts` - Route registration
- ✅ `src/api/handlers/executeAgentHandler.ts` - Handler implementation
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway routing
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEBUG.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ `test-endpoint.js` - Local testing script

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- [ ] Railway deployment completes without errors
- [ ] Server logs show route registration confirmation
- [ ] Postman request returns 200 OK with proper JSON response
- [ ] No more 404 errors on `/execute-agent` endpoint

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**
Once deployed successfully:
1. Test with Postman using the exact request above
2. Verify response matches expected format
3. Test additional actions (SMS, contact updates, etc.)
4. Document working endpoint URL for AI agent integrations

## 🔍 **ADDITIONAL TESTING**

### Test Health Endpoint First:
```bash
curl https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "clients": 3,
  "version": "1.1.1"
}
```

### Test 404 Handler:
```bash
curl https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/invalid-route
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Route not found: GET /invalid-route",
  "availableRoutes": [
    "GET /health",
    "POST /execute-agent",
    "POST /execute-legacy",
    "POST /clients",
    "GET /clients",
    "DELETE /clients/:clientId",
    "POST /sessions"
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY FIXES**

### If deployment fails:
1. **Force rebuild**: `railway up --force`
2. **Check build logs** for TypeScript compilation errors
3. **Verify dependencies** are installed correctly
4. **Check Railway service status** in dashboard

### If environment variables missing:
- Set `PORT` (Railway usually sets this automatically)
- Verify `GHL_API_KEY` if needed for legacy endpoints
- Check Railway environment variables section

## 📊 **MONITORING**

### Watch for these log patterns:
- ✅ `✅ /execute-agent route registered` - Route is active
- ✅ `🤖 Agent execution request received` - Endpoint is being hit
- ❌ `❌ 404 - Route not found` - Route not registered
- ❌ `❌ Agent execution error` - Handler errors

**The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. The 404 error should be resolved once deployed to Railway.**
