# 🚨 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**

The 404 error is caused by **missing or incorrect environment variables**. The application is trying to use environment variables that don't exist in Railway, causing the server to fail silently or not start properly.

## 📋 **CURRENT RAILWAY VARIABLES**
From the screenshot, Railway has:
- ✅ `GHL_API_KEY`
- ✅ `GHL_LOCATION_ID` 
- ✅ `PIT_BG`
- ❌ Missing: `GHL_LOCATION_ID_ASB`
- ❌ Missing: `PIT_ASB`

## 🔧 **REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

### **For client_BG:**
- `GHL_LOCATION_ID` - ✅ Already exists
- `PIT_BG` - ✅ Already exists

### **For client_ASB Financial:**
- `GHL_LOCATION_ID_ASB` - ❌ **MISSING**
- `PIT_ASB` - ❌ **MISSING**

### **For client_American Senior Benefits:**
- `GHL_LOCATION_ID_ASB` - ❌ **MISSING** 
- `PIT_ASB` - ❌ **MISSING**

## 🚀 **SOLUTION: ADD MISSING VARIABLES**

### **Step 1: Add Missing Variables in Railway Dashboard**

Go to Railway Dashboard → Variables and add:

1. **`GHL_LOCATION_ID_ASB`**
   - Value: `dsVEq34SgqUiiY64mdBT`
   - Description: Location ID for ASB Financial and American Senior Benefits

2. **`PIT_ASB`**
   - Value: `pit-03e2ec41-db31-4f8c-94bf-ef3e878b6a65`
   - Description: PIT token for ASB Financial and American Senior Benefits

### **Step 2: Verify All Variables**

After adding, Railway should have:
```
✅ GHL_API_KEY
✅ GHL_LOCATION_ID
✅ PIT_BG
✅ GHL_LOCATION_ID_ASB (NEW)
✅ PIT_ASB (NEW)
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy Application**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix environment variables: Use Railway env vars instead of hardcoded values"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Test 1: Health Check**
```bash
curl https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/health
```

### **Test 2: Execute Agent**
```bash
curl -X POST https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/execute-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentName": "nora",
    "clientId": "client_BG",
    "input": "Create a contact named John Doe with email john.doe@example.com"
  }'
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT**

After adding the missing environment variables:
1. ✅ Server will start properly with all required variables
2. ✅ `/execute-agent` endpoint will respond with 200 OK
3. ✅ No more 404 errors

## 🚨 **ALTERNATIVE: USE ONLY client_BG**

If you want to test immediately without adding the missing variables, modify the request to use only `client_BG`:

```json
{
  "agentName": "nora",
  "clientId": "client_BG",
  "input": "Create a contact named John Doe with email john.doe@example.com"
}
```

This should work because `client_BG` has all required variables (`GHL_LOCATION_ID` and `PIT_BG`).

**The 404 error is caused by missing environment variables, not routing issues.**
