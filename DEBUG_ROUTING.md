# üö® CRITICAL ROUTING ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## üîç **EVIDENCE ANALYSIS**

### **Railway Logs Show:**
- ‚úÖ Server running on port 8080
- ‚úÖ `/execute-agent` route confirmed registered
- ‚úÖ All routes properly listed
- ‚úÖ Server ready for production

### **Postman Shows:**
- ‚ùå 404 error on `https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/execute-agent`
- ‚ùå "Cannot POST /execute-agent"

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE: RAILWAY ROUTING MISCONFIGURATION**

The issue is that **Railway's internal routing is not forwarding requests correctly**. The server is running and the route is registered, but Railway's proxy/routing layer is not delivering requests to the application.

## üîß **SOLUTION: FIX RAILWAY CONFIGURATION**

### **Step 1: Remove railway.toml (It's causing routing conflicts)**
```bash
rm railway.toml
```

### **Step 2: Update railway.json with correct configuration**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Ensure server binds to correct port**
The server must bind to `0.0.0.0` and use the `PORT` environment variable that Railway provides.

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

1. **Remove railway.toml:**
   ```bash
   rm railway.toml
   ```

2. **Update railway.json:**
   ```bash
   # Update the file with the configuration above
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway routing: Remove railway.toml, update railway.json"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   - Check Railway logs for successful startup
   - Test `/health` endpoint first
   - Then test `/execute-agent` endpoint

## üß™ **TESTING SEQUENCE**

1. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Test Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/test
   ```

3. **Execute Agent:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://primary-production-1ca15.up.railway.app/execute-agent \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"agentName":"nora","clientId":"client_BG","input":"test"}'
   ```

## üéØ **EXPECTED RESULT**

After removing `railway.toml` and updating `railway.json`, Railway will:
1. Use its default routing (which works correctly)
2. Forward all requests to the application
3. The `/execute-agent` endpoint will respond with 200 OK

**The 404 error is caused by Railway's routing configuration, not the application code.**
